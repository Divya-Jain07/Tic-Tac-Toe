Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is my second project using JavaScript, where I built a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.
The interface is simple and interactive, allowing two players to play alternately and check for a winner or a draw.

Features::
1. Two-player mode with X and O
2. Prompts to enter Player 1 and Player 2 names
3. Automatic winner and draw detection
4. Reset option to restart the game

Technologies Used::
1. HTML for structure
2. CSS for styling
3. JavaScript for functionality

How to Play::

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Enter Player 1 and Player 2 names when prompted.
3. Players take turns clicking on the grid to mark X or O.
4. The game declares the winner or a draw when conditions are met.
5. Click "Reset" to start a new game.
